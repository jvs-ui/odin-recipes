    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A popular Indo Chinese recipe prepared with leftover rice, scrambled eggs, assorted veggies and spicy schezwan sauce. This 15 minutes recipe is perfect for weekday meals. Try it!</p>
    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice – Leftover (1-2 days old) white rice gives you the best results when added in the fried rice. Incase you are making fresh rice, let it cook down fully or refrigerate it for a few hours before mixing in with other ingredients</li>
        <li>Vegetables – I like to loaded my fried rice recipes with capsicum, beans, cabbage, and carrots as it adds a beautiful crunch. You can even add red/yellow bell pepper, spring onions, mushroom, zucchini, broccoli, etc.</li>
        <li>Egg – Scrambled eggs adds an extra taste and flavour along with veggies. You can also add chicken or prawns if you want to add extra protein.</li>
        <li>Schezwan Sauce – The star ingredient, which makes this recipe different from the regular fried rice recipes.</li>
        <li>Cumin powder</li>
        <li>Coriander powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoon of oil in a wok.</li> 
        <li>When oil becomes hot, add ginger and garlic. Saute for just few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add capsicum, beans, cabbage and carrots. Saute all veggies for 2-3 mins. Don’t overcook them.</li>
        <li>Add schezwan sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, salt, chilli oil and black pepper and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>add rice</li>
